# Lab 4: Assign Standard Administrator Roles

**Objective:** Assign least privilege administrative roles.  
**Scenario:** Nina Shah needs reporting access.

---

## Steps
1. Go to **Security → Administrators**.
2. Review role: **Report Administrator**.
3. Assign role to Nina Shah.
4. Verify Nina’s admin view only includes:
   - Dashboard
   - Reports
   - Settings
5. Check system logs for "Grant user privilege" event.

## Why This Matters
- **IAM Relevance:** Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) enforces least privilege.  
- **Okta Platform Use:** Prevents over-privileged accounts by splitting admin duties.  
- **Business Value:** Reduces insider risk and meets compliance requirements for separation of duties.
